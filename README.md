MAZE GAME:
  - a game basically designed to see if I could make a decent command system, akin to the old text based adventure games.
  - pretty basic, probably super sloppy coding

PLANS FOR FUTURE
================
    -at the moment, the maze is just a static, hard coded one. want to find a way to randomly generate it
    -possibily add some 'events' such as finding treasure, bad guys, traps etc. Would require some fancy addiditons first, such as 
    a health system and inventory
