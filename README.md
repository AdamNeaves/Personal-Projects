==============
MAZE GAME:
  - a game basically designed to see if I could make a decent command system, akin to the old text based adventure games.
  - pretty basic, probably super sloppy coding

PLANS FOR FUTURE
================
    -Square maze is now randomly generated from an inputed wall length. It's buggy but works, for now
    -possibily add some 'events' such as finding treasure, bad guys, traps etc. Would require some fancy addiditons first, such as      a health system and inventory
